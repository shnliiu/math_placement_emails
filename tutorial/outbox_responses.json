Thank you for reaching out to us regarding your math placement at Cal Poly. I'm happy to help clarify this for you.\n\nHi there, congratulations on your admission to Cal Poly! I'd be happy to help provide some guidance on the Math Placement Exam (MAPE). The MAPE is used to determine your readiness for certain math courses like Precalculus or Calculus. Whether you need to take it depends on a few factors: After you accept your admission offer, you'll need to complete the Math Placement Survey. This will give Cal Poly a sense of your math background based on things like test scores and prior coursework. From there, they'll let you know if you need to submit any additional documentation or take the MAPE. The MAPE can be taken online through August 31st using an online proctoring service called ProctorU. But I'd encourage you to take it sooner if possible, ideally by July 31st. That way, if you do need to adjust your math placement before course scheduling begins, there will be more flexibility. Don't stress too much about it for now though! Just be sure to accept your offer, complete that initial survey, and then Cal Poly will guide you through the next steps. Feel free to reach out to the math department if any other questions come up along the way. Wishing you an awesome start to your Cal Poly journey!\n\nI hope this information is helpful in guiding your next steps. Should you have any additional questions or need further clarification, please feel free to visit our math placement chatbot at https://mathplacement.calpoly.edu for immediate assistance.\n\nWe're here to support you in your academic journey at Cal Poly, so please don't hesitate to reach out if you need anything else.\n\nWarm regards,\nCal Poly Math Placement Team\nMathematics Department\nCalifornia Polytechnic State University\n\n---\nThis is an automated response designed to provide you with immediate assistance. For urgent matters, please contact the Math Department directly.\n"

    "response": "\nTO: student2@example.com\nSUBJECT: Re: AP Calc confusion\nBODY:\nDear Student2,\n\nI hope this message finds you well! Thank you for reaching out to us regarding your math placement at Cal Poly. I'm happy to help clarify this for you.\n\nHi there! Thanks for reaching out about your math placement. I'm happy to help provide some guidance on your situation. Since you took AP Calculus AB in high school but received a score of 2, which does not qualify for Cal Poly credit, you will likely need to take the Math Placement Exam (MAPE) to demonstrate your readiness for calculus-level coursework. The MAPE is a great opportunity to show what you know and potentially place into a higher math course right away. Even though your AP score didn't meet the requirement, the exam will allow you to prove your calculus skills. Don't worry though, it's just a diagnostic test - it can only help advance your placement, not set you back. I'd encourage you to take advantage of the free online review modules to refresh your knowledge before the exam. The process is pretty straightforward - after accepting your admission, you'll complete the Math Placement Survey which will prompt next steps for either submitting test scores or taking the MAPE. Just be sure to schedule your MAPE appointment at least 72 hours in advance. Don't hesitate to reach out if you have any other questions! We're here to support you in getting accurately placed so you can start off on the right track.\n\nI hope this information is helpful in guiding your next steps.

Thank you for reaching out to us regarding your math placement at Cal Poly. I'm happy to help clarify this for you.\n\nHi there! Thanks for reaching out about taking the Math Placement Exam (MAPE) while you're out of state.

This allows you to take the exam from anywhere with a reliable internet connection. All you need to do is schedule your exam appointment at least 72 hours in advance on the ProctorU website. The virtual MAPE option is available until August 31st for new incoming students. I know taking important exams online can feel a bit daunting, but ProctorU has a user-friendly system to guide you through the process. And don't worry, they have measures in place to ensure academic integrity. If you need any accommodations for the exam, just be sure to get those approved through Cal Poly's Disability Resource Center beforehand.\n\nLet me know if you have any other questions! The math department wants to make sure you're able to get an accurate placement so you can start off on the right track in your math courses here.
