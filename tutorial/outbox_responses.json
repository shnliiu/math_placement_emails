    "response": "Dear Student1,\n\nThank you for your math placement inquiry at Cal Poly.\n\nHi there, congratulations on your admission to Cal Poly! I'd be happy to help provide some guidance on the Math Placement Exam (MAPE). The MAPE is used to determine your readiness for certain math courses like Precalculus or Calculus. Whether you need to take it depends on a few factors: After you accept your admission offer, you'll need to complete the Math Placement Survey. This will give Cal Poly a sense of your math background based on things like test scores and prior coursework. From there, they'll let you know if you need to submit any additional documentation or take the MAPE. The MAPE can be taken online through August 31st using an online proctoring service called ProctorU. But I'd encourage you to take it sooner if possible, ideally by July 31st. That way, if you do need to adjust your math placement before course scheduling begins, there will be more flexibility. Don't stress too much about it for now though! Just be sure to accept your offer, complete that initial survey, and then Cal Poly will guide you through the next steps. Feel free to reach out to the Math Department if any other questions come up along the way. They're happy to help make sure you're set up for success!\n\nI hope this information is helpful.

    "response": "Dear Student2,\n\nThank you for your math placement inquiry at Cal Poly.\n\nHi there! Thanks for reaching out about your math placement. I'm happy to help provide some guidance on your situation. Since you took AP Calculus AB in high school but received a score of 2, which does not qualify for Cal Poly credit, you will likely need to take the Math Placement Exam (MAPE) to demonstrate your readiness for calculus-level coursework. The MAPE is a great opportunity to show what you know and potentially place into a higher math course right away. Even though your AP score didn't meet the requirement, the exam will allow you to prove your calculus skills. Don't worry though, it's just a diagnostic exam - it can only help advance your placement, not set you back. I'd encourage you to take advantage of the free online review resources to prepare and do your best on the MAPE. The process is pretty straightforward - once you accept your admission, you'll get instructions on your portal to take the Math Placement Survey. After that, you should be able to schedule your MAPE exam. The testing center staff are super helpful if you have any other questions along the way. I know preparing for these exams can feel stressful, but try to stay positive! You've got this.\n\nI hope this information is helpful.

I'm happy to help provide some guidance on that.\n\nThe great news is that Cal Poly offers the MAPE virtually through an online proctoring service called ProctorU. This allows you to take the exam from anywhere with a reliable internet connection. All you need to do is schedule your exam appointment at least 72 hours in advance on the ProctorU website. The virtual MAPE option is available until August 31st for new incoming students. I know taking important exams online can feel a bit daunting, but ProctorU has a user-friendly system to guide you through the process. And don't worry, they have measures in place to ensure academic integrity. If you need any accommodations for the exam, just be sure to get those approved through Cal Poly's Disability Resource Center beforehand.\n\nLet me know if you have any other questions! The math department wants to make sure you're able to get an accurate placement so you can start off on the right track in your math courses here. Wishing you all the best as you prepare to join the Mustang family!\n\nI hope this information is helpful.
