Thank you for reaching out to us regarding your math placement at Cal Poly. I'm happy to help clarify this for you.\n\nHi there, congratulations on your admission to Cal Poly! I'd be happy to help provide some guidance on the Math Placement Exam (MAPE). The MAPE is used to determine your readiness for certain math courses like Precalculus or Calculus. Whether you need to take it depends on a few factors: After you accept your admission offer, you'll need to complete the Math Placement Survey. This will give Cal Poly a sense of your math background based on things like AP scores or prior coursework. From there, they'll let you know if you need to submit any additional documentation or take the MAPE to demonstrate your current skill level. The great news is that for new Fall 2025 admits, the MAPE can be taken online through a proctoring service called ProctorU at no cost until August 31st. Just be sure to schedule your exam at least 72 hours in advance. Taking the MAPE by July 31st is recommended so you can get your proper math placement before course scheduling begins. Don't stress too much about it for now. Once you complete those initial steps, Cal Poly will provide clear guidance on what you need to do next regarding math placement. The important thing is you're being proactive and asking the right questions! Feel free to reach out to the Math Department if you have any other concerns. Wishing you an awesome start to your Cal Poly journey!\n\nI hope this information is helpful in guiding your next steps. Should you have any additional questions or need further clarification, please feel free to visit our math placement chatbot at https://mathplacement.calpoly.edu for immediate assistance.\n\nWe're here to support you in your academic journey at Cal Poly, so please don't hesitate to reach out if you need anything else.\n\nWarm regards,\nCal Poly Math Placement Team\nMathematics Department\nCalifornia Polytechnic State University\n\n---\nThis is an automated response designed to provide you with immediate assistance.

    "response": "\nTO: student2@example.com\nSUBJECT: Re: AP Calc confusion\nBODY:\nDear Student2,\n\nI hope this message finds you well! Thank you for reaching out to us regarding your math placement at Cal Poly. I'm happy to help clarify this for you.\n\nHi there! Thanks for reaching out about your math placement. I'm happy to help provide some guidance on your situation. Since you took AP Calculus AB in high school but received a score of 2, which does not qualify for Cal Poly credit, you will likely need to take the Math Placement Exam (MAPE) to demonstrate your readiness for calculus-level coursework. The MAPE is a great opportunity to show what you know and potentially place into a higher math course right away. Even though your AP score didn't meet the requirement, the exam will allow you to prove your calculus skills. Don't worry though, it's just a diagnostic exam - it can only help advance your placement, not set you back. I'd encourage you to take advantage of the free online review resources to prepare and do your best on the MAPE. The process is pretty straightforward - once you accept your admission, you'll get instructions on your portal to take the Math Placement Survey. After that, you should be able to schedule your MAPE exam. The testing center staff are super helpful if you have any other questions along the way. I know preparing for these exams can feel stressful, but try to stay positive! You've got this.\n\nI hope this information is helpful in guiding your next steps.
