    "response": "Dear Student1,\n\n\nHi there, and congratulations on your admission to Cal Poly! I'm happy to help provide guidance on the Math Placement Exam (MAPE) process.\n\nAfter accepting your admission offer, you'll need to complete the Math Placement Survey via the link on your To-Do list in the MyCalPoly portal. This survey will determine your preliminary math placement based on your prior coursework and test scores. Once you complete the survey, check your email and To-Do list for next steps. You may be asked to:\n\n- Send official test scores or transcripts to Cal Poly\n- Take the MAPE exam, which can be done virtually through ProctorU until August 31st\n\nThe MAPE allows you to demonstrate readiness for math courses up to Calculus I (MATH 141). Be sure to take the MAPE by July 31st if possible, as this will ensure proper course placement before scheduling begins. If you have a qualifying AP Calculus score or have already completed a transferable calculus course, you may not need to take the MAPE. However, it's best to follow the specific instructions on your To-Do list after completing the survey.\n\nPlease let me know if you have any other questions! I'm here to help make the math placement process as smooth as possible.\n\nI hope this information is helpful. If you have additional questions, please visit our math placement chatbot at https://math.calpoly.edu/reqs-exams\n\nBest regards,\nCal Poly Math Placement Team\nMathematics Department\n\n---\nOriginal question from student1@example.com:\nHi, I got admitted to Cal Poly and I'm not sure if I need to take the MAPE.

    },
    "response": "Dear Student2,\n\n\nThank you for your question. Based on your score of 2 on the AP Calculus AB exam, you will need to take the Math Placement Exam (MAPE) to determine your appropriate first math course at Cal Poly. A score of 2 on the AP Calculus AB exam does not confer any course credit or eligibility for specific math courses. The MAPE is a diagnostic exam that can demonstrate your eligibility up to Calculus I (MATH 141). You can take the MAPE online through the proctoring service ProctorU at no cost until August 31st. Appointments must be scheduled at least 72 hours in advance. **Key Points:**\n- A score of 2 on AP Calculus AB does not grant course credit or eligibility\n- You need to take the MAPE to determine proper math placement\n- The MAPE can be taken online through ProctorU until August 31st\n- Schedule your MAPE appointment at least 72 hours in advance\n\nI hope this information is helpful.
